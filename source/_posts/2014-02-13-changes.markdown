####Change #1

So i've finally decided to change things, since time itself wouldn't move my [blog](http://remoteexception.blogspot.com) over to github.

Initially i started the blog to hold portuguese translations of a weekly Burt Beckwith's compilation of Grails related info.

It's time to blog more often.

**Change #2**

But in the last 3 years a lot has changed. I went from Grails to Rails, deployed a complex application and those steps lead me here ...

Here is where ?

Well here is deciding to learn a functional programming language.

Here is deciding to keep on walking, one step at a time, towards the path of lesser complexity.

Here is Erlang and Elixir.

**Change #3**

I've also decided it was time to change from Sublime Text to something more terse. And i did. After a couple of days i've uninstalled Sublime and i'm now a happy vim learner.
